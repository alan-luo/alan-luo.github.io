# Convolution

**[View the project here](/src/conv.html)**.

This was a Javascript demo I made to visualize 1-dimensional [convolution]().

Convolution is an operation that gets a lot of fuss nowadays due to its use in [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs). But the operation itself is quite simple. I made this page as a visual explanation to demystify convolution.

# Sketches from Bygone Days

[Link to collection](http://alan-luo.github.io/demos/).

This is an old collection of demos, back when I thought stacked box shadows are cool. (Though they still kinda are.) Many of these I didn't consider enough to warrant their own page, which is why they're held separately here.

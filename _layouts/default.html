			<p>Hello! I'm Alan Luo.</p>
			<p>I'm a creative coder, developer, and student.</p>
			<p>But in my mind, I'm a game designer. I believe that the essence of play is fundamental to the human experience. I try to bring it into everything I do.</p>
			<p>I have a lot of interests and questionable perspectives. To learn more about them: Experience my buffoonery through my <a href="#projects">projects</a> (below), or scrutinize my brain cells through the links above. Or even better, press the button below.</p>

# Introduction

Hello! I'm Alan.

If you're here, it means you've gone out of your way to learn more about me. Which is a little interesting, because I don't think I'm that worth learning about. (At least not yet. I'm working on it.)

But, since you've come this far, it's no holds barred. I'll show you my authentic self. Well, not completely. But at least a bit more than what you might see on [Twitter]({{ site.data.links.twitter }}).

Sound good? Cool.

# Mission

I believe that we must always be kind. 

We learn, we work, and we create all for the purpose of connecting with our fellow humans.

The problem is that it can be pretty hard to connect with someone when you don't speak their language. It's even harder if you can't fly to where they live. That's what technology is for. The internet connects us.

But here's something odd: Do you actually feel more connected? How many of your closest friends have you made through the internet? And how many of them are from countries others than your own?

The problem is dilution. It's now possible to connect with everyone, yet you have no common language through which to speak. If you think about it, the Internet is like a large public schools, where you can connect with thousands of people but end up only having a few close friends.

How can we close this gap?

For me, the answer is games. I believe that the essence of play is fundamental to the human experience. Why is it so easy to make friends in elementary school? Playground games. What do teams do to get to know one another? Icebreaker games. Who are the first adopters for digital communities like forums and Discord? Gamers.

With this in mind, my mission is at follows: Make games that connect people.

# Life so far

One day, I want to make awesome games. But until then, I'll have to settle for making mediocre games while learning as much as I can.

After high school, I took a year off, during which I did some freelancing and also worked as a software engineer. Now, I'm studying computer science at Columbia University.

# And beyond...

I'm still young. Only time will tell what exciting things the future may bring.

Until then, if you're interested in hearing more about how I think, visit my [blog]({{ site.data.links.blog }}) or follow me on [Twitter]({{ site.data.links.twitter }}).

# Introduction

Hello! I'm Alan.

If you're here, it means you've gone out of your way to learn more about me. Which is a little interesting, because I don't think I'm that worth learning about. (At least not yet. I'm working on it.)

But, since you've come this far, it's no holds barred. I'll show you my authentic self. Well, not completely. But at least a bit more than what you might see on Twitter.

Sound good? Cool.
